# Github Projects

A Chrome Extension to help you manage the projects you're working on.

## What does it do?

It's aim is to make a Basecamp style starred projects view on your Github home page. While working across many org's and repos, it can be a pain to keep track of what you're working on. So the idea is that you star a repo and it'll be available from your home page!

## Installation

To install from source, clone down the repo and then go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in Chrome.

Check "Developer Mode" and then click "Load unpacked extension...". Choose the the repo you just cloned down and you should be good to go.
