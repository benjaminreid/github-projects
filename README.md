# Github Projects

A Chrome Extension to help you manage the projects you're working on.

## What does it do?

It allows you to seamlessly bookmark repo's on Github to your home page.

A new "Save Repo" button is added to any repo's you visit.

They'll then appear on your dashboard for easy access. **They're also synced across your Google account in Chrome**.
